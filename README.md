#Assignments 

In this repository, you can find a compilation of most of the assignments that I have completed over the span of my (not-yet-completed) academic career. Please use this README file to browse through the repository, as I have tried my best to make the list as comprehensive as possible. I have hyperlinked the assignments to their respective location in this folder, and I have also included brief descriptions for each assignment and course. I hope that this reposity will br able to give you an idea of my progression as a programmer.
