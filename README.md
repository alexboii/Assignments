#Assignments 

In this repository, you can find a compilation of most of the programming assignments that I have completed over the span of my (not-yet-completed) academic career. Please use this README file to browse through the repository, as I have tried my best to make the list as comprehensive as possible. I have hyperlinked the assignments to their respective location in this folder, and I have also included brief descriptions for each assignment and course. I hope that this reposity will br able to give you an idea of my progression as a developer.

###[Assignment 1](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/tree/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%201) 

The purpose of this assignment was to get us accustomed to writing BASH scripts. The second part of the assignment consisted of writing a script that would endlessly open a given list of images in a certain order until manually interrupted. If an image is closed, the script has to reopen it. The third part was about sorting animals according to the attributes specified by the user (weight, length, alphabetical). Two outputs had to be produced: one with a sorted list of animal names and another one with a sorted list of images.
