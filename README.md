#Assignments 

In this repository, you can find a compilation of most of the programming assignments that I have completed over the span of my (not-yet-completed) academic career. Please use this README file to browse through the repository, as I have tried my best to make the list as comprehensive as possible. I have hyperlinked the assignments to their respective location in this folder, and I have also included brief descriptions for each assignment and course. I hope that this reposity will br able to give you an idea of my progression as a developer.

##[COMP 206](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs206/)

<i>"Comprehensive overview of programming in C, use of system calls and libraries, debugging and testing of code; use of developmental tools like make, version control systems."</i> 

###[Assignment 1](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/tree/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%201) 

The purpose of this assignment was to get us accustomed to writing BASH scripts. The [second part of the assignment](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%201/q2.bash) consisted of writing a script that would endlessly open a given list of images in a certain order until manually interrupted. If an image is closed, the script has to reopen it. The [third part](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%201/q3.bash) was about sorting animals according to the attributes specified by the user (weight, length, alphabetical). Two outputs had to be produced: one with a sorted list of animal names and another one with a sorted list of images. 

###[Assignment 2](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/tree/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%202) 

This assignment was an introduction to C and it allowed us to explore the way the language interacts with the Linux terminal. The [first question](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%202/q1.c) translates a date piped as an argument from the shell to a given input language. The [second question](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%202/q2.c) was an exercise in ASCII art. It prints a the calendar for a year in different languages given a starting day offset and a maximum number of characters to print out. 

###[Assignment 3](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/tree/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%203)

In this assignment, we explored C's dynamic memory allocation in depth. [Part A](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%203/q1a_decrypt.c) of the first question was about decrypting files encoded with the [Caesarean cipher algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), provided the correct key. [Part B](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%203/q1b_crack.c) of the first question cracked down the key of an encrypted text. [The second question](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%203/q2_text_chat.c) is an implementation of a simple chat, where two users interact through two different terminal windows. [The third question](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%203/q3_encrypted_chat.c) combines the concepts from the two questions above to create an encrypted chat client. 

###[Assignment 4](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/tree/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%204)

The pedagogical objective of this assignment was to "[learn]  basic  Python  programming  skills  in  domains  where  Python  is  effec-tive, and especially as applied to problems that would be difficult in C." [The first question](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%204/q1_word_count.py) counts each occurrence of the words from a given input file. [The second question](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%204/q2_pair_count.py) counts each word pair in a given text. [The third question] implements a very primitive chatbot which constructs its answer based on word associations from one or several input files.   

###[Assignment 5](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/tree/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%205)

The pedagogical objective of this assignment was to "[implement] a larger software system that includes components from the web, C libraries written by others, as well as [my] own code written in Python in order to produce a functional integrated system." In the [first question](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%205/q1_image_filter.py), we had to write a Python program with the use of ctypes which would apply filters to an input image. Then, [the second question](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%205/q2_filter_with_history.py) extended the functionality of the first question by implementing an operation history with the help of Python's pickle module, which allowed the user to load, undo and redo filter applications for a given image. [The third question](https://github.com/alexboii/Assignments/blob/master/McGill%20University/COMP%20206%20-%20Intro%20to%20Software%20Systems/Assignment%205/q3_cgi_filter.py) was simply an implementation of the same program, but adapted to Python CGI. A running web version can be found [here](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~abraty/A5Q3_template.html).

##[COMP 250](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jeromew/comp250.html)
<i>"An introduction to the design of computer algorithms, including basic data structures, analysis of algorithms, and establishing correctness of programs. Overview of topics in computer science."</i> 

<i>For the most part, the assignments for this class were in written form, although the ones below included parts in which we had to do some coding.</i>
